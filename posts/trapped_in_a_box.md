There is a box around everybody that most of us spend their whole lives in. Some of us manages to figure out its existence and succeed in moving out of that box. But most of us waste our whole life unaware of this fact and struggling to find the solution to our little problems which doesn’t even impact anybody outside this box of ours. Then, we look at these people who manages to unbox themselves and wonder what exactly they did differently to achieve such heights in their lives what we can only dream of.

Life is not a journey, life is not a mystery, life is not a gift or a game. In fact, life is just a time period and it depends solely upon us what we turn it into. The only thing that is required to live a life is an aim and enough ambition and motivation to attain it. Now what you aim depends on whether you are aware of this box that encloses you are not. When I was a child, in my early teenage, I wanted to become a scientist. The motivation was the respect they get from this society. As I grew older, my interest in computers grew as well. It was mostly gaming at first. But the touch of mouse, keyboard clicks, working in ms word and paint, everything served as a motivation to me. I then decided to be a computer engineer. I still had an aim though it changed to a more realistic one. I completed my post graduation in computer science and working in the IT industry as a software developer for last three years. All was well till this point. Now, I don’t have any more ambition. The money is not my passion, I just need it for my survival and whatever I make is more than enough for it. The work doesn’t motivate me much, I worked only hard enough to earn this software developer title but not enough to make some groundbreaking invention in this field. As it was never my goal. The only thing I regret now is that I never considered going out of the box. Was I aware of its existence? Probably yes, but just like any other mediocre person, I was too consumed, by the comfort the box provided, to peek out of it.

Everybody regrets something. Some regret making wrong decisions and some for not even making any decision. It’s always better to try and fail than to not try at all. Because even in losing we gain something, experience. Yes, a bitter one, but it still counts.  All of us knows this, but still a very few actually realise it.

*“Look at me, what do you see?“*, she asked.

*“A beautiful face and a prettier soul.”*, I replied and she smiled. We were quite happy inside our own little box.
