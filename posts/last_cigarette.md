excerpt : "Most of the times I spend dwelling over my past rather than enjoying the present or planning about my future. Somtimes it brings smile on my face and sometimes it's just the regret that things could have happened in a better way."

It was time to go to bed. To fall asleep and dive into my dreams. I took the packet and lit the cigarette. It was the last one left. Ten puffs and end of the day for me. Took the first one and remembered my first love. She was damn beautiful and so was my first puff. Inhaled deep and it made its way to my lungs. Filled it with nicotine just the way she filled my heart with those emotions. Few moments of peace, few moments of happiness. I exhaled the remaining tar, as the lungs couldn’t absorbed the all. She too found a new love as my emotions were not enough for her. She moved on but I couldn’t. Stuck in that loop forever.

With second puff, the freshness was fading. The mind, the body and the emotions were saturating. The thought of reliving my childhood popped into my mind. Was there a way to go back in time, to attend those classes, to impress those teachers, to make fun of friends and to eat their lunches. It was now just a vague memory.

The third puff but my mind was still in the past. My first crush was a teacher of my class. I didn’t have any chance, she was quite older than me. But as she was unmarried, I did once thought might be.

The fourth brought me back to the reality. The pressure to grow was now taking its toll. Thought myself as an audience but now was a part of this rat race. Didn’t know when priority had changed. Instead of finding love, making money was the new aim. The flesh the blood the body was no more. Had turned into a machine running on tar and alcohol.


The fifth, the sixth and the seventh. The journey was now boring but had to make. The eighth puff suddenly made me realize. The cigarette had become quite shorter but not the night.

**The last puff ended and I returned to my bed. Confused whether it was going to be a new morning or another night instead.**
