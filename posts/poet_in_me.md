### Few more shots

I looked up at the counter,  
At the emptied glass and bottle,  
The bar was quiet and dull,  
The feeling of void and null.  
Trying to put me at ease,  
I asked, “few more shots please”  

Life is a wait to die, they say,  
Love is against the god they pray.  
I stood against the devil they are,  
but she, the angel, left midway.  
Lonely, tired like a standstill breeze,  
I asked, “few more shots please”  

The cape I wore, the mask I tried,  
The fake emotions and the synthetic smile.  
But the pain of losing her in this war,  
turned into a nightmare, I failed to hide.  
Gasping for a fresh feeling to breathe,    
I asked, “few more shots please”

### Broken
I got that text from her,  
And all my fear came true,  
I am in love with someone, it read,  
someone better than you.  

What about the promises she made,  
to live together and die,  
to share all the moments together,  
in all lows and highs.   

Promises are meant to be broken, she claimed,  
but what she didn’t realize,  
her promises weren’t the only thing,  
my heart too broke that night.  

I gathered all my courage,  
and put all my pain behind,  
wished her all the happiness and luck,  
leaving all that was once mine.  

It came like a hurricane,  
destroying everything at once,  
and went like a stone-cold wind,  
freezing my heart and emotions.  

The fall was too deep, the slope was too steep,  
the journey that followed, was lonely and dark,  
time heals the broken heart they say,  
but even when glued it leaves the mark.

### Prisoner
It was too dark too quiet,  
With no happiness in the sight,  
He looked up at the sky,   
Hoping to find a route to fly,  
Surrounded by the walls he built,  
He was a prisoner for life.  

She was living her dream,  
Love from all around,  
A life full of colors and sound,  
A tiny sacrifice she had made,  
Left him for this instead.

### Afraid
Afraid of the dark and the light  
Afraid of the sound and the sight,  
I am afraid of all things around,  
I am tired, sad, and down.  

It’s hard to blame God,  
the atheist in me can’t just nod.  
To carry the weight of the past,  
My weak soul and shoulder won’t last.  

Seeing her again, I believe,  
will be more pain than I can feel.  
It’s good to stay always away,  
From her life, her story, and her prays.  

Life Life Life, mind cries,  
Every second a part of me dies.  
Not much life has remained,  
but this heartless body might just survive.  

It’s time to say goodbye,  
to the love and to the lies.  
It’s time to say goodbye,  
and end this low on a high.

### A lost soul
I saw her first, sitting in the dark,  
Under the lonely sky, in a deserted park  
I asked her name and she turned around,  
She murmured something with insufficient sound.  
I looked at her face and she looked at me,  
Oh my god, how lovely was she.  
I think, at that instant, I got hypnotized,  
By that beautiful lips and those lovely eyes.  
By the time I regained my sense,  
She was gone, I was left there alone.  
Under that lonely sky, in that deserted park,  
Where I saw her first, sitting in the dark.  

I saw her again, after three years nearly,  
I was visiting a hospital, as an orderly.  
With lots of vein like pipes around her head,  
She was lying there isolated on a hospital bed.  
What happened to those lovely eyes & beautiful lips,  
Instead, there were two yellow shells & bloodless calyx.  
But the thing that again pulled me towards her,  
Was softness in her eyes that I had seen when I first met her.  
I went near her bed, near her motionless head,  
And asked her why she was looking like a dead.  
She murmured something with insufficient sound,  
Again I failed to hear and I looked around.  
Later I found, she was suffering from cancer,  
With no hope to live and pain growing denser.  
I left her there with her parents to care,  
And me with my pain, to find someone to share.
