<h3 id="few-more-shots">Few more shots</h3>
<p>I looked up at the counter,<br>At the emptied glass and bottle,<br>The bar was quiet and dull,<br>The feeling of void and null.<br>Trying to put me at ease,<br>I asked, “few more shots please”  </p>
<p>Life is a wait to die, they say,<br>Love is against the god they pray.<br>I stood against the devil they are,<br>but she, the angel, left midway.<br>Lonely, tired like a standstill breeze,<br>I asked, “few more shots please”  </p>
<p>The cape I wore, the mask I tried,<br>The fake emotions and the synthetic smile.<br>But the pain of losing her in this war,<br>turned into a nightmare, I failed to hide.<br>Gasping for a fresh feeling to breathe,<br>I asked, “few more shots please”    </p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3 id="broken">Broken</h3>
<p>I got that text from her,<br>And all my fear came true,<br>I am in love with someone, it read,<br>someone better than you.  </p>
<p>What about the promises she made,<br>to live together and die,<br>to share all the moments together,<br>in all lows and highs.   </p>
<p>Promises are meant to be broken, she claimed,<br>but what she didn’t realize,<br>her promises weren’t the only thing,<br>my heart too broke that night.  </p>
<p>I gathered all my courage,<br>and put all my pain behind,<br>wished her all the happiness and luck,<br>leaving all that was once mine.  </p>
<p>It came like a hurricane,<br>destroying everything at once,<br>and went like a stone-cold wind,<br>freezing my heart and emotions.  </p>
<p>The fall was too deep, the slope was too steep,<br>the journey that followed, was lonely and dark,<br>time heals the broken heart they say,<br>but even when glued it leaves the mark.  </p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3 id="prisoner">Prisoner</h3>
<p>It was too dark too quiet,<br>With no happiness in the sight,<br>He looked up at the sky,<br>Hoping to find a route to fly,<br>Surrounded by the walls he built,<br>He was a prisoner for life.  </p>
<p>She was living her dream,<br>Love from all around,<br>A life full of colors and sound,<br>A tiny sacrifice she had made,<br>Left him for this instead.  </p>
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3 id="afraid">Afraid</h3>
<p>Afraid of the dark and the light<br>Afraid of the sound and the sight,<br>I am afraid of all things around,<br>I am tired, sad, and down.  </p>
<p>It’s hard to blame God,<br>the atheist in me can’t just nod.<br>To carry the weight of the past,<br>My weak soul and shoulder won’t last.  </p>
<p>Seeing her again, I believe,<br>will be more pain than I can feel.<br>It’s good to stay always away,<br>From her life, her story, and her prays.  </p>
<p>Life Life Life, mind cries,<br>Every second a part of me dies.<br>Not much life has remained,<br>but this heartless body might just survive.  </p>
<p>It’s time to say goodbye,<br>to the love and to the lies.<br>It’s time to say goodbye,<br>and end this low on a high.  </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="a-lost-soul">A lost soul</h3>
<p>I saw her first, sitting in the dark,<br>Under the lonely sky, in a deserted park<br>I asked her name and she turned around,<br>She murmured something with insufficient sound.<br>I looked at her face and she looked at me,<br>Oh my god, how lovely was she.<br>I think, at that instant, I got hypnotized,<br>By that beautiful lips and those lovely eyes.<br>By the time I regained my sense,<br>She was gone, I was left there alone.<br>Under that lonely sky, in that deserted park,<br>Where I saw her first, sitting in the dark.  </p>
<p>I saw her again, after three years nearly,<br>I was visiting a hospital, as an orderly.<br>With lots of vein like pipes around her head,<br>She was lying there isolated on a hospital bed.<br>What happened to those lovely eyes &amp; beautiful lips,<br>Instead, there were two yellow shells &amp; bloodless calyx.<br>But the thing that again pulled me towards her,<br>Was softness in her eyes that I had seen when I first met her.<br>I went near her bed, near her motionless head,<br>And asked her why she was looking like a dead.<br>She murmured something with insufficient sound,<br>Again I failed to hear and I looked around.<br>Later I found, she was suffering from cancer,<br>With no hope to live and pain growing denser.<br>I left her there with her parents to care,<br>And me with my pain, to find someone to share. </p>
